### Getting an API Key
- Visit iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/.
- Select the “Individual” account type, then enter your name, email address, and a password, and click “Create account”.
- Once registered, scroll down to “Get started for free” and click “Select Start plan” to choose the free plan.
- Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, visit https://iexcloud.io/console/tokens.
- Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with `pk_`).
- If you are using a Linux distribution, open `run.sh` and paste the key directly after the `=` and run it (you may need to set the script to executable).
- If you are using Windows, open `run.cmd` and paste the key directly after the `=` and run it.
